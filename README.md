# Bestelling-Books

Bestselling Books will be a data visualization project utilizing the New York Times Books API to pull data on NYT Bestsellers and display it by year and genre. Users will have the ability to search for results by year, and results will then be dynamically displayed to the user. There will be icons on the side of the results page for various genres so that users can see results by genre.

Users will also be able to see information about how long a book has been on the bestseller list and its highest rank. This will be overlayed on top of the page, using javascript and D3.js, when a user hovers over a book title.

In Bestselling Books, users will be able to:

- Search for the top 5 bestselling books by year
- See results displayed by genre
- See other data related to each book in chart form

In addition, this project will include:

- a production README
